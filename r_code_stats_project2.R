# Measurement data of polar bears captured in the Chukchi
# and Southern Beaufort seas, 1981 - 2017

### Data
# Data is available from the Alaska Science Center at https://alaska.usgs.gov/products/data.php?dataid=315
# alternatively from data.world at https://data.world/us-doi-gov/581f789d-efa1-45db-a542-4812bed49004
# Data is made available by the Department of the Interior, US Government

### Data Upload
# set working directory, eg. setwd("~/R_Stats")

# load requiring packages
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)

### to do: 
#  - comment on data: what is the data set about and where does it come from? How many observations and variables are there? Which are the names and types of your variables? What do they represent? 
#  - clean data: removing NAs, changing columnsâ€™ names and/or types, creating new columns, removing unnecessary columns, filtering observations, creating additional data frames/matrices/lists/vectors
#  - do an EDA (explorative data analysis): calculate summary statistics of your variables and visualize their univariate and bivariate distributions
#  - formulate at least an hypothesis and test it. You should comment the results of your test(s) and say if your hypothesis is supported or not by your data.

### graphs: 
# histogram of average number of accompanying cubs per mature female
# what is the age of the females in correlation to their number of cubs
# function of age and length: show growing phase
# age distribution 
# skull width correlation to sex
# heart girth correlation to age and sex --> if we figure out how they measured the hearts
# mass correlation with sex
# 


# histogram of average number of accompanying cubs per mature female
install.packages("naniar")
library(naniar) # this package allows us to change values to nas

polar5 <- (polar4$cubs_male30[polar4$cubs_male30==30] <- "NA") # 30s in the cubs column are replaced with NAs
