# Measurement data of polar bears captured in the Chukchi
# and Southern Beaufort seas, 1981 - 2017

### Data
# Data is available from the Alaska Science Center at https://alaska.usgs.gov/products/data.php?dataid=315
# alternatively from data.world at https://data.world/us-doi-gov/581f789d-efa1-45db-a542-4812bed49004
# Data is made available by the Department of the Interior, US Government

### Data Upload
# set working directory, eg. setwd("~/R_Stats")

# load requiring packages
library(ggplot2) # create aesthetic graphs
library(tidyverse) # used to make a tidy dataset to work with
library(GGally) # extension of ggplot
library(patchwork) # patch plots together easily
library(naniar) # this package allows us to change values to NAs
library(dplyr) # needed for filtering

# load the dataset
polar <- read.csv("polar.csv", header = TRUE)

# take a first look at the dataset
glimpse(polar)

# originally the data contained 22 columns,of which a few held no data however, in 3174 rows
# the variables showed measured data of captured polarbears, including the collecting agency, 
# the population group, 
# the date of capture, 
# the BearID (some bears were captured multiple times throughout their life over the years),
# the bears sex, age, length (standard and total),
# the bears heart girth, skull width, tail length, mass, 
# a score that represents their physical condition
# the number of cubs that accompanied them, the cubs age
# the bears gut fill, litter mass
# their fat amount, gut fill, snout length, resistence, body fat percentage (but all these contained no data)

# rename columns and change necessary data types
polar <- polar %>% 
  rename(agency = Collecting_Agency , population = Population, bearID = BearID, sex = Sex,
         age = Age, total_length = Total_Length, standard_length = Standard_Length, mass = Mass, 
         cubs = Number_of_cubs, heart = Heart_Girth, skull = Skull_Width) %>% 
  mutate(age  = as.integer(age),
         total_length = as.double(total_length),
         standard_length = as.double(standard_length),
         mass = as.double(mass), cubs = as.integer(cubs), 
         heart = as.double(heart), skull = as.double(skull))

# create a subset of only the relevant columns
polar1 <- subset(polar, select = c("agency", "population", "Date", "bearID", "sex", "age", 
                                   "total_length", "standard_length", "mass", "cubs", "heart", "skull"))

### EDA: look to see where NAs can be found in the dataset
# as well as look at some statistical parameters, including minimum value, 1st quantile, median, mean, 3rd quantile and maximum value
summary(polar1)

# we look at the first and last few lines of the dataset to see if everything is cohesive
head(polar1) 
tail(polar1)

# remove NAs
# however the NAs in the cub column cannot simply be removed, as no cubs accompany male bears our young (immature) females
cubs_male30<- polar1$cubs %>% replace_na(30) # change male/young female NAs to 30 in the cubs column 
# (as this value is unrealistic and cannot be mistaken with any real cub count)

# now subset the columns without the old cubs column
polar2 <- subset(polar, select = c("agency", "population", "Date", "bearID", "sex", "age", 
                                   "total_length", "standard_length", "mass", "heart", "skull"))
# add in the new column with the NAs changed to 30
polar3 <- cbind(polar2, cubs_male30)

# now omit all NAs in the dataset
polar4 <- na.omit(polar3) 

# we looked at some further parameters for some interesting variables
range(polar4$mass)
var(polar4$mass)
range(polar4$total_length)
var(polar4$total_length)

# cleaning data for average number of accompanying cubs per mature female

polar4$cubs_male30[polar4$cubs_male30==30] <- "NA" # 30s in the cubs column are replaced with NAs

# again subset the relevant columns for the mature female dataset
polar5 <- polar4 %>% 
  select(bearID, cubs_male30, age, total_length, standard_length, mass, heart, skull) %>%
  filter(cubs_male30 != "NA") # filter out the NAs so we only have rows for mature females

# change the column names for cubs and mutate them to be integer
colnames(polar5)[2] <- "cubs" 
polar5 <- polar5 %>% mutate(cubs = as.integer(cubs))

### hypothesis
# our first hypothesis concerns the correlation between Total length of Polarbears and their Mass
# H0 is stated as: Total length and Mass are not positively correlated,
# and H1 is stated as: Total length and Mass are positively correlated
# to test this we use the function cor.test, and specify greater as the alternative
cor.test(polar4$total_length, polar4$mass, alternative = "greater")
# the Pearson's product-moment correlation shows a p-value of less than 0.05, meaning the correlation is significant
# the correlation value is 0.86, showing a strong positive correlation between length and mass of polarbears
# this means we can reject H0 and accept H1

# create plot to show correlation, with geom_smooth adding the correlation as a line for visualization
scatter_hyp1 <- ggplot(data = polar4) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = total_length, y = mass), alpha = 0.3) +

# our second hypothesis tries to correlate the number of cubs in mature female polarbears with their mass, 
# as we saw a decreasing trend in the graphs above
# H0 is stated as: there is no negative correlation between number of cubs and mass 
# H1 is stated as: there is a negative correlation between number of cubs and mass
# we again use function cor.test
cor.test(polar5$cubs, polar5$mass, alternative = "less")
# this time the Pearson's correlation gave a p-value of 0.9
# as this is not smaller than 0.05, the test of correlation was not significant
# the correlation comes out to be -0.16
# we therefore can neither reject nor accept H1

# now we create a plot that shows the non-significant correlation
