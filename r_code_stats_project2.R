### Data Upload
# set working directory, eg. setwd("~/R_Stats")

# load requiring packages
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)

# load the dataset
polar <- read.csv("data/polar.csv", header = TRUE)

# take a first look at the dataset
glimpse(polar)

# originally the data contained 22 columns,of which a few held no data however, in 3174 rows
# the variables showed measurements of captured polarbears, including the collecting agency, 
# the population group, the date of capture, the BearID (some of the bears were captured multiple times througout the years),
# the bears sex, age, length (standard and total),
# the bears heart girth, skull width, tail length, mass, 
# a score that represents their physical condition
# the number of cubs that accompanied them when they were captured, the cubs age
# the bears gut fill, litter mass
# their fat amount, gut fill, snout length, resistence, body fat percentage (but all these contained no data)

# rename columns and change necessary data types
polar <- polar %>% 
rename(agency = Collecting_Agency , population = Population, bearID = BearID, sex = Sex,
       age = Age, total_length = Total_Length, standard_length = Standard_Length, mass = Mass, 
       cubs = Number_of_cubs, heart = Heart_Girth, skull = Skull_Width) %>% 
  mutate(age  = as.integer(age),
         total_length = as.double(total_length),
         standard_length = as.double(standard_length),
         mass = as.double(mass), cubs = as.integer(cubs), 
         heart = as.double(heart), skull = as.double(skull))

# create a subset of only the relevant columns
polar1 <- subset(polar, select = c("agency", "population", "Date", "bearID", "sex", "age", 
                                   "total_length", "standard_length", "mass", "cubs", "heart", "skull"))

# show a summary to see where NAs can be found in the dataset
# as well as look at some statistical parameters, including minimum value, 1st quantile, median, mean, 3rd quantile and maximum value
summary(polar1)

# remove NAs
# however the NAs in the cub column cannot simply be removed, as no cubs accompany male bears our young (immature) females
cubs_male30<- polar1$cubs %>% replace_na(30) # change male/young female NAs to 30 in the cubs column 
# (as this value is unrealistic and cannot be mistaken with any real cub count)

# now subset the columns without the old cubs column
polar2 <- subset(polar, select = c("agency", "population", "Date", "bearID", "sex", "age", 
                                "total_length", "standard_length", "mass", "heart", "skull"))
 # add in the new column with the NAs changed to 30
polar3 <- cbind(polar2, cubs_male30)

# now omit all NAs in the dataset
polar4 <- na.omit(polar3) 


### to do: 
#  - comment on data: what is the data set about and where does it come from? How many observations and variables are there? Which are the names and types of your variables? What do they represent? 
#  - clean data: removing NAs, changing columnsâ€™ names and/or types, creating new columns, removing unnecessary columns, filtering observations, creating additional data frames/matrices/lists/vectors
#  - do an EDA (explorative data analysis): calculate summary statistics of your variables and visualize their univariate and bivariate distributions
#  - formulate at least an hypothesis and test it. You should comment the results of your test(s) and say if your hypothesis is supported or not by your data.

### graphs ?
# histogram of average number of accompanying cubs per mature female
# what is the age of the females in correlation to their number of cubs
# function of age and length: show growing phase
# age distribution 
# skull width correlation to sex
# heart girth correlation to age and sex --> if we figure out how they measured the hearts
# mass correlation with sex
